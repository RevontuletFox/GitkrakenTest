# GitkrakenTest

this repo is created to make sure GitKraken is working
fine, its a shitty process

I firstly installed an old version of GitKraken to get access to free features
it automatically updated itself then the launchpad, new tab and every panel didn't display any ui
then i rolled back to the specific old version only to find its disability to login with github

shit bug

I deleted all files related to GitKraken using "Everything" and reinstalled the newest version and finally get things right

DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL ANY OLDER VERSION OF GitKraken

Remenber to use ipconfig/flushdns in cmd before push/pull.
